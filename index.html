						<p>
							Duck Races are virtual events where participants "adopt" ducks with dollars per duck, and then watch them race down a virtual waterway or track on a website or through a mobile app. Participants pick a duck (or multiple ducks) from a list of available options, which are represented by numbers. Each number is assigned the name of the person requesting the number, and during the race, these names are used to track the progress of the ducks as they "swim" or "race" towards the finish line. The outcome of the race is determined by a random number generator or algorithm that simulates the movement of the ducks based on chance. Spectators can watch the race unfold in real-time via live. Anyone active in the community can organize a race. The organizer of the race is responsible for specifying the bottle the race will be for, specifying the amount of dollars per slot, collecting names and dollars, and inputting their names with their corresponding selected number. Once the numbers are filled, the race live.
